      text: "is a new initiative in Belgium for kids and teenagers to discover, experiment, learn and play with technology (robots, coding, gaming, 3D printing...), trough one-week tech camps and one-day discovery workshops. Let's unlock their creativity!"
    intro: "Our objective is to instill the maker's spirit, deconstruct to better reconstruct and understand the inner working of things. Our workshops are fun (we laugh!), hands-on (we make things) and long-lived (we take back our projects home to further develop them)."

        title: "Build Your Own Robotic Arm"
        description: "For our first robotic workshop, we'll build a robotic arm! Sure, our arm won't be as sophisticated as the ones you see in movies, but we promise it'll be mighty impressive! To build it, we'll use lots of cool stuff, including an Arduino (a small computer which holds in your hand), servomotors, popsicle sticks, soldering irons... And to guide us, we'll have the great maker-artist-inventor master... Julien Dutertre."
        date: "Wednesday, November 4, 2015, from 9am to 5pm"
        location: "Co.Station, Parvis Sainte-Gudule 5, 1000 Bruxelles"
        age: "Teenagers (boys and girls), from 13 to 17 years old"
        price: "The workshop is free. However, if you wish to keep your robotic arm (and the Arduino board),<br>you will be able to buy the material at the end of the day at a discounted price of 50 euros.<br><br>"
        price_why: "Why 50 euros? Because our coaches are professionals and because participants will return home with their arm... and all its components (including the Arduino, the servomotors, potentiometers, power, etc.)"

        title: "Create Your First Web Page"
        description: "For our first web design workshop, we'll build a webpage from scratch! There are thousands of reasons why you should learn to code a webpage: launch your own fashion blog, showcase your latest sporting feats, prepare for your dream career in San Francisco...Each participant will code their own webpage, using HTML, CSS and JS languages. YES, these are programming languages, but don't fret, anybody can use them and we'll guide you through it. Also on the programme: choice and customization of a template (to beautify your webpage in a snap) and deployment of the webpage (i.e. making it available on the web). "
