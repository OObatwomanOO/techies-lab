        title: "Build Your Own Robotic Arm"
        description: "For our first robotic workshop, we'll build a robotic arm! Sure, our arm won't be as sophisticated as the ones you see in movies, but we promise it'll be mighty impressive! To build it, we'll use lots of cool stuff, including an Arduino (a small computer which holds in your hand), servomotors, popsicle sticks, soldering irons... And to guide us, we'll have the great maker-artist-inventor master... Julien Dutertre."
        date: "Wednesday, November 4, 2015, from 9am to 5pm"
        location: "Co.Station, Parvis Sainte-Gudule 5, 1000 Bruxelles"
        age: "13 to 17 y.o."
        price: "EUR 50 per participant"
        price_why: "Why 50 euros? Because our coaches are professionals and because participants will return home with their arm... and all its components (including the Arduino, the servomotors, potentiometers, power, etc.)"

        title: "Create Your First Web Page"
        description: "For our first web design workshop, we'll build a webpage from scratch! There are thousands of reasons why you should learn to code a webpage: launch your own fashion blog, showcase your latest sporting feats, prepare for your dream career in San Francisco...Each participant will code their own webpage, using HTML, CSS and JS languages. YES, these are programming languages, but don't fret, anybody can use them and we'll guide you through it. Also on the programme: choice and customization of a template (to beautify your webpage in a snap) and deployment of the webpage (i.e. making it available on the web). "
