    intro: "Our objective is to instill the maker's spirit, deconstruct to better reconstruct and understand the inner working of things.<br><br>Our workshops are fun (we laugh!), hands-on (we make things) and long-lived (we take back our projects home to further develop them)."

        title: "Build Your Own Robotic Arm"
        description: "For our first robotic workshop, we'll build a robotic arm! Sure, our arm won't be as sophisticated as the ones you see in movies, but we promise it'll be mighty impressive! To build it, we'll use lots of cool stuff, including an Arduino board (a small computer which holds in your hand), servomotors, popsicle sticks, soldering irons... And to guide us, we'll have the great maker-artist-inventor master... Julien Dutertre."
        date: "Wednesday, November 4, 2015, from 9am to 5pm"
        location: "Co.Station, Place Sainte-Gudule 5, 1000 Bruxelles"
        age: "Teenagers (boys and girls), from 13 to 17 years old"
        price: "50 &#8364; per participant"
        price_why: "Why 50 &#8364;? Because our coaches are professionals and because participants will return home with their arm... and all its components<br>(including the Arduino board, the servomotors, potentiometers, power, etc.)"

        title: "Create Your First Web Page"
        description: "For our first web design workshop, we'll build a web page from scratch! There are thousands of reasons why you should learn to code a web page: launch your own fashion blog, showcase your latest sporting feats, prepare for your dream career in San Francisco... Each participant will code their own web page, using HTML, CSS and JS languages. YES, programming languages, but don't fret, anybody can use them and we'll guide you through it. Also on the programme: choice and customization of a template (to beautify your web page in a snap) and deployment of the web page (i.e. making it available on the web)."
