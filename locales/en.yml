        description: "For our first robotic workshop, we'll build a robotic arm! Sure, our arm won't be as sophisticated as the ones you see in movies, but we promise it'll be mighty impressive! To build it, we'll use lots of cool stuff, including an Arduino board (a small computer which holds in your hand), servomotors, popsicle sticks, soldering irons... And to guide us, we'll have the great maker-artist-inventor master... Julien Dutertre."

        description: "For our first web design workshop,
        we'll build a web page from scratch! There are
        thousands of reasons why you should learn to code
        a web page: launch your own fashion blog, showcase
        your latest sporting feats, prepare for your dream
        career in San Francisco... Each participant will code
        their own web page, using HTML, CSS and JS languages.
        YES, programming languages, but don't fret, anybody
        can use them and we'll guide you through it.
        Also on the programme: choice and customization
        of a template (to beautify your web page in a snap)
        and deployment of the web page (i.e. making it available
        on the web)."

        code can be, by learning in a few hours to design and
        build together your first web page from scratch!
        We'll pick up where we left off last workshop:
        we'll go deeper in CSS, we'll learn how to add
        videos, and we'll maybe even add a spark of JavaScript
        (that's the language to create animations).
        To finish, we'll learn how to deploy, i.e. make our
        pages accessible on the web!"
