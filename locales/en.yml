      text: "is a new initiative in Belgium for kids (from 8 to 12 years old) and teenagers (from 13 to 17 years old) to discover, experiment, learn and play with technology (robots, coding, gaming, 3D printing...). Through one-week tech camps and one-day discovery workshops, we will foster our Techies' creativity!"
    intro: "Our objective is to instill the maker's spirit, deconstruct to better reconstruct and understand the inner working of things. Our workshops are fun (we laugh!), hands-on (we make things) and long-lived (we take back our projects home to further develop them)."

An ambassador of Rails Girls, she loves helping newcomers to see the bright light in their eyes when the magic of coding gets unveiled! One year ago, she put on rails (and since then, drives) Le Wagon Brussels, the coding school for startups, creative people and entrepreneurs."

    description_margo: "At the age of 6, Margo was writing textbooks for her brothers. Since, her passion for education is unweavering. When she's not busy creating workshops and running the Techies Lab's operations, Margo develops Kidzeum, a fun and educative app for museums. In another life she was a lawyer in Canada... but that was before discovering Belgian fries!"

        title: "Build Your Own Robotic Arm"
        description: "For our first robotic workshop, we'll build a robotic arm! Sure, our arm won't be as sophisticated as the ones you see in movies, but we promise it'll be mighty impressive! To build it, we'll use lots of cool stuff, including an Arduino board (a small computer which holds in your hand), servomotors, popsicle sticks, soldering irons... And to guide us, we'll have the great maker-artist-inventor master... Julien Dutertre."
        date: "Wednesday, November 4, 2015, from 9am to 5pm"
        age: "Teenagers (boys and girls), from 13 to 17 years old"
        price: "The workshop is free. However, if you wish to keep your robotic arm (and the Arduino board),<br>you will be able to buy the material at the end of the day at a discounted price of 50 euros.<br><br>"
        price_why: "Why 50 &#8364;? Because our coaches are professionals and because participants will return home with their arm... and all its components<br>(including the Arduino board, the servomotors, potentiometers, power, etc.)"

        description: "You will learn, step by step with us, how to make your plant (mini Xmas tree) twinkle, sing (no kidding) and/or alert you when it needs watering, by using an Arduino board to measure the humidity of the ground and to produce various sounds accordingly."
        date: "Saturday, December 12, 2015, from 9am to 5pm"

        description: "For our first web design workshop, we'll build a web page from scratch! There are thousands of reasons why you should learn to code a web page: launch your own fashion blog, showcase your latest sporting feats, prepare for your dream career in San Francisco... Each participant will code their own web page, using HTML, CSS and JS languages. YES, programming languages, but don't fret, anybody can use them and we'll guide you through it. Also on the programme: choice and customization of a template (to beautify your web page in a snap) and deployment of the web page (i.e. making it available on the web)."

We'll pick up where we left off last workshop: we'll go deeper in CSS, we'll learn how to add videos, and we'll maybe even add a spark of JavaScript (that's the language to create animations). To finish, we'll learn how to deploy, i.e. make our pages accessible on the web!"
